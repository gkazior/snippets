## My keys

...Key............Key.............Key... | Meaning
---------------------------- | ------------------------
Alt + Enter                  | show intention actions (like Eclipse quick fix)
Alt + Shift + Insert         | switches to column selection mode, allowing the selection of rectangular text fragments (columns)
Ctrl + Alt + V               | introduce variable (never type the left hand side of an assignment again)
Ctrl + Alt + T               | Surround code block. Another useful stuff.
Ctrl + Shift + A             | * Pick action *
Ctrl + Shift + Backspace     | go to most recent code edit. Hit again to go even further back. Very useful when coding something, browsing other classes for a while and then wanting to go back where we left our code.
Ctrl + Shift + Space         | smart completion ( even two levels down since IntelliJ 8 )
Ctrl + Shift + V             | paste one of the previous values from clipboard
Ctrl + F11                   | invokes a dialog with all alphanumeric keys on the keyboard. Selecting one empty will add the current line to bookmarks and mark the line with selected key.
  Shift + F11                | invokes a list of bookmarks. Pressing a key takes to associated bookmark.
Ctrl + W                     | select succesively increasing code blocks. Kind of obvious but a real time saver!
