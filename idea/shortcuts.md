         Key            | Meaning
------------------------|------------------------
Alt + Enter             | show intention actions (like Eclipse quick fix)
Ctrl + Alt + V          | introduce variable (never type the left hand side of an assignment again)
Ctrl + Shift + Space    | smart completion ( even two levels down since IntelliJ 8 )
Ctrl + W                | select succesively increasing code blocks. Kind of obvious but a real time saver!
